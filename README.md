My basic storage shed for projects and coding, take a peek, if you dare! (Mwahahaha)

I'm a bit of what you'd call a "self proclaimed nerd", I enjoy gaming, anime, collecting movies, playing guitar, singing, as well as many other random activities as they may occur along the course of an average year.
